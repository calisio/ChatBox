how to remove from usersArray on closing the window?
	disconnect
	


display rooms for other users immediately after creation

room name not displaying for second user

1 user not getting pushed into array for each room



create object for user
	socket id
	username
	banned rooms
	etc.






//creative portion
delete chat room
notify others that person left




probably need to clear chatRoomsDisplayed when going back to chatroomlist page




BREAKTHROUGH:
send events back to cleint from server using room.in(room) (something like that)
define functions in chatroom.html js using socketio.on("event")s instead of plain js functions
	so that it only updates DOM elements in that specific room
