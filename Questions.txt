how to remove from usersArray on closing the window?
	disconnect (?)
	


1 user not getting pushed into array for each room

change "user has signed off" message to "user has left room"
	unless they completely sign off ?

add chat functions both in homeroom and private rooms



//creative portion
delete chat room
notify others that person left
