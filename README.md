# Creative Portion
For our creative portion, we first implemented the ability to make other users admins.  Admins (similar to the creator of the room) can make other users admins, ban users and kick users from the room.  Upon leaving a room, they lose their admin powers (except for the creator - they keep their admin powers upon leaving/rejoining).

We also gave users the ability to sign out, and rejoin with a different nickname.  They lose all admin powers and all messages are cleared, but the same rooms (assuming none have been added/deleted) will be available.
